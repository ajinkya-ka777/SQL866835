Thank you for your support, Naga.

As discussed on the call, I have made the following changes:

1. Added a condition to check if the instance is in the 'Running' state. This will help prevent issues arising from instances that are not currently running.


2. Added a condition to filter only online databases in the T-SQL script. This will help avoid errors in stored procedure commands.
