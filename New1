Our script currently produces an output with a total of 8 columns. However, the Tanium team has set a limit of 5 columns for CSV outputs. To work around this, weâ€™ve split the script into two separate scripts: one that outputs 4 columns and another that outputs 5.

We can later merge these outputs in Splunk to bring all 8 columns together.
